    <h4 class="odd">INSTALL/UNINSTALL</h4>

    <p class="even">No special measures necessary, follow the standard installation process â€“
        extract the module folder into the ../modules directory. Install the
        module through Admin -> System Module -> Modules.<br> <br>
        Detailed instructions on installing modules are available in the
        <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/book/xoops/xoops-operations-guide/" target="_blank">XOOPS Operations Manual</a>
        <br> <br>

        This module makes use of plugins. Without plugins there will be nothing to see.
        Available plugins are located at /mycomments/plugins.<br> <br>
    </p>

    <h4 class="odd">Developing plugins</h4>

    <p class="even">Plugins are based on the "What's new" module plugins. With little effort you can adapt them to work
        with mycomments.
        If you are a module developer you can include your plugins under yourmodule/include/mycomments.plugin.php<br>
        <br>
        The plugin should also work for modules that use XOOPS_TRUST_PATH.<br> <br>

        You can send your plugin to lusopoemas@gmail.com if you want me to add it to mycomments/plugins folder.<br> <br>
    </p>
